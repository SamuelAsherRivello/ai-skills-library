# AI Skills Library Push

Use this skill only to copy global Codex skills into the local library checkout. It does not publish changes to GitHub.

1. Require exactly one argument: a skill folder name or the literal `all`.
2. Resolve the global source as `$HOME/.agents/skills` and the library destination as this repository's `.agents/skills`. Show both full paths and the selected scope. Known `ai-skills-create-*`, `ai-skills-library-*`, `openspec-*`, and Docker sandbox skill names map to their matching categories. Ask the user to select one of those categories for any unmapped name before running the helper.
3. For a named skill, validate the selected source. For `all`, select every valid top-level global skill directory. A valid skill is a real directory containing `SKILL.md`; refuse a symbolic link or junction as the selected directory and refuse linked files or directories within it.
4. When the library checkout is available, use its `scripts/skill-copy-lifecycle.ps1` helper with `-Action push -Skill <name|all>`. Pass `-Category <category>` for an unmapped named skill after the user chooses its category. Preflight the complete selection before copying anything. A missing/invalid source, invalid destination, unapproved conflict, or inability to write to the checkout fails the operation without changing any skill. If the checkout is not writable, clearly say no skills changed and suggest asking a library maintainer to import the skill.
5. If source and destination contents match, skip that skill. If a destination is absent, plan a physical directory copy. If destination contents differ, report the conflict and ask the user whether to replace it. Do not use `-ReplaceConflicts` unless the user explicitly authorizes replacement; for `all`, show every conflict and get approval before replacing any.
6. Copy only after every selected skill passes preflight. Verify each destination is a physical directory with `SKILL.md` and content matching its source. If a copy fails, remove only directories newly created by this invocation, leaving sources and pre-existing destinations unchanged.
7. Report `Changed`, `Skipped`, and `Failed` names separately. Do not create a junction or symbolic link, move/delete a source, fetch/commit/push Git history, or modify unrelated skills. If the helper is unavailable, follow these same steps with filesystem copy operations.

## Library checkout exception

When running from inside the `ai-skills-library` checkout, treat its categorized `.agents/skills/<category>/<skill>` tree as the canonical catalog. `push all` remains the supported operation for importing global skills into that catalog; preserve the category layout and preflight every selected skill before copying. For a named global skill, use `push` with the appropriate category.
